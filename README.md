# model-ai-bird-classification-tflite
## Overview
This repository provides a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for bird classification, leveraging MobileNet V2 for efficient and accurate predictions. MobileNet V2 is known for its lightweight architecture, which makes it ideal for on-device inference, allowing the model to perform real-time classification on mobile and edge devices.

## Features
 - **Pre-trained Model:** Includes a TFLite model optimized for bird classification using MobileNet V2.
 - **MobileNet V2 Architecture:** Utilizes MobileNet V2 for efficient computation and reduced model size while maintaining high accuracy.
 - **Real-Time Inference:** Designed for on-device deployment with low-latency predictions.
 - **High Accuracy:** Achieved through training on a comprehensive dataset of bird images.
 - **Easy Integration:** Sample code and instructions provided for integrating the model into mobile applications.

## MobileNet V2
The model uses MobileNet V2 as its backbone architecture. MobileNet V2 is a depthwise separable convolutional network that provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for mobile and embedded applications.

## Dataset
The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of bird images, covering various species to ensure robust classification performance. For details on the dataset used, please refer to the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) (525 birds species).
